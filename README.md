# Game of Life

Initializes a fixed-size board with a random state and then shows a number of "iterations" of the board following the rules of the Game of Life.

Quickly got it to working condition, but a bunch of things still need work:

* Draw, the display is ugly
* Method for counting live neighbours is ripe for refactoring
